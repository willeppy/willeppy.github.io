&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical practices such as building regression models or running hypothesis tests rely on following rigorous procedures of steps and verifying assumptions on data to produce valid results. However, common statistical tools do not verify users’ decision choices and provide low-level statistical functions without instructions on the whole analysis practice. Users can easily misuse analysis methods, potentially decreasing the validity of results. To address this problem, we introduce GuidedStats, an interactive interface within computational notebooks that encapsulates guidance, models, visualization, and exportable results into interactive workflows. It breaks down typical analysis processes, such as linear regression and two-sample T-tests, into interactive steps supplemented with automatic visualizations and explanations for step-wise evaluation. Users can iterate on input choices to refine their models, while recommended actions and exports allow the user to continue their analysis in code. Case studies show how GuidedStats offers valuable instructions for conducting fluid statistical analyses while finding possible assumption violations in the underlying data, supporting flexible and accurate statistical analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profiling data by plotting distributions and analyzing summary statistics is a critical step throughout data analysis. Currently, this process is 
manual and tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists 
profiling their data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for them to miss important errors or insights. We propose 
continuous data profiling as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual summaries of their data throughout their data analysis 
to facilitate fast and thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support continuous data profiling: (1) it automatically displays 
data distributions and summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; (2) it is live, so visualizations are always accessible and update automatically 
as the data updates; (3) it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code for the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, 
we evaluate two versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, 
however, one version updates reactively (“live”) and the other updates only on demand (“dead”). We find that both tools, dead or alive, facilitate insight 
discovery with 91% of user-generated insights originating from the tools rather than manual profiling code written by users. Participants found live updates 
intuitive and felt it helped them verify their transformations while those with on-demand profiles liked the ability to look at past visualizations. We also 
present a longitudinal case study on how AutoProfiler helped domain scientists find serendipitous insights about their data through automatic, live data 
profiles. Our results have implications for the design of future tools that offer automated data analysis support.&lt;/p&gt;

      Solas tracks the history of a user’s analysis to provide improved in situ visualization recommendations. Above, a user has most
recently created the Class column that is visualized on the left side of the interface. Recently executed Pandas commands interacted with
Worldwide_Gross, Viewership, and MPAA_Rating; therefore, Class is shown relative to these columns.


    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing visualization recommendation systems commonly rely on a single snapshot of a dataset to suggest visualizations to users. 
However, exploratory data analysis involves a series of related interactions with a dataset over time rather than one-off analytical steps. 
We present Solas, a tool that tracks the history of a user’s data analysis, models their interest in each column, and 
uses this information to provide visualization recommendations, all within the user’s native analytical environment. 
Recommending with analysis history improves visualizations in three primary ways: task-specific visualizations use the provenance of 
data to provide sensible encodings for common analysis functions, aggregated history is used to rank visualizations by our model of a 
user’s interest in each column, and column data types are inferred based on applied operations. We present a usage scenario and a user evaluation 
demonstrating how leveraging analysis history improves in situ visualization recommendations on real-world analysis tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

Above, a user has most recently created the Class column that is visualized on the left side of the interface. Recently executed Pandas commands interacted with Worldwide_Gross, Viewership, and MPAA_Rating; therefore, Class is shown relative to these columns. Abstract Existing visualization recommendation systems commonly rely on a single snapshot of a dataset to suggest visualizations to users. However, exploratory data analysis involves a series of related interactions with a dataset over time rather than one-off analytical steps. We present Solas, a tool that tracks the history of a user’s data analysis, models their interest in each column, and uses this information to provide visualization recommendations, all within the user’s native analytical environment. Recommending with analysis history improves visualizations in three primary ways: task-specific visualizations use the provenance of data to provide sensible encodings for common analysis functions, aggregated history is used to rank visualizations by our model of a user’s interest in each column, and column data types are inferred based on applied operations. We present a usage scenario and a user evaluation demonstrating how leveraging analysis history improves in situ visualization recommendations on real-world analysis tasks.

While existing tools help data scientists track changes in code, they provide less support for understanding the iterative changes that the code produces in the data. 
We explore the idea of visualizing differences in datasets as a core feature of exploratory data analysis, a concept we call Diff in the Loop (DITL).

To better understand current practices, we conducted interviews (N=17) and a survey (N=132) with data scientists at Microsoft, and extract five commonly used strategies for sharing and reuse of past work: 
personal analysis reuse, personal utility libraries, team shared analysis code, team shared template notebooks, and team shared libraries. 
We also identify factors that encourage or discourage data scientists from sharing and reusing. 
Our participants described obstacles to reuse and sharing including a lack of incentives to create shared code, difficulties in making data science code modular, and a lack of tool interoperability. 
We discuss how future tools might help meet these needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      FairVis integrates multiple coordinated views for discovering intersectional bias. 
Above, our user investigates the intersectional subgroups of &lt;i&gt;sex&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;race&lt;/i&gt;. 
A. The Feature Distribution View allows users to visualize each feature&apos;s distribution and generate subgroups.
B. The Subgroup Overview lets users select various fairness metrics to see the global average per metric and compare subgroups to one another, e.g., pinned Caucasian Males versus hovered African-American Males.
The plots for &lt;i&gt;Recall&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;False Positive Rate&lt;/i&gt; show that for African-American Males, the model has relatively high recall but also the highest false positive rate out of all subgroups of sex and race. 
C. The Detailed Comparison View lets users compare the details of two groups and investigate their class balances.
Since the difference in False Positive Rates between Caucasian Males and African-American Males is far larger than their difference in base rates, a user suspects this part of the model merits further inquiry. 
D. The Suggested and Similar Subgroup View shows suggested subgroups ranked by the worst performance in a given metric.


    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing capability and accessibility of machine learning has led to its application to many real-world domains and data about people.
Despite the benefits algorithmic systems may bring, models can reflect, inject, or exacerbate implicit and explicit societal biases into their outputs, disadvantaging certain demographic subgroups.
Discovering which biases a machine learning model has introduced is a great challenge, due to the numerous definitions of fairness and the large number of potentially impacted subgroups.
We present FairVis, a mixed-initiative visual analytics system that integrates a novel subgroup discovery technique for users to audit the fairness of machine learning models.
Through FairVis, users can apply domain knowledge to generate and investigate known subgroups, and explore suggested and similar subgroups.
FairVis’ coordinated views enable users to explore a high-level overview of subgroup performance and subsequently drill down into detailed investigation of specific subgroups.
We show how FairVis helps to discover biases in two real datasets used in predicting income and recidivism.
As a visual analytics system devoted to discovering bias in machine learning, FairVis demonstrates how interactive visualization may help data scientists and the general public understand and create more equitable algorithmic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

Above, our user investigates the intersectional subgroups of sex and race. A. The Feature Distribution View allows users to visualize each feature&apos;s distribution and generate subgroups. B. The Subgroup Overview lets users select various fairness metrics to see the global average per metric and compare subgroups to one another, e.g., pinned Caucasian Males versus hovered African-American Males. The plots for Recall and False Positive Rate show that for African-American Males, the model has relatively high recall but also the highest false positive rate out of all subgroups of sex and race. C. The Detailed Comparison View lets users compare the details of two groups and investigate their class balances. Since the difference in False Positive Rates between Caucasian Males and African-American Males is far larger than their difference in base rates, a user suspects this part of the model merits further inquiry. D. The Suggested and Similar Subgroup View shows suggested subgroups ranked by the worst performance in a given metric. Abstract The growing capability and accessibility of machine learning has led to its application to many real-world domains and data about people. Despite the benefits algorithmic systems may bring, models can reflect, inject, or exacerbate implicit and explicit societal biases into their outputs, disadvantaging certain demographic subgroups. Discovering which biases a machine learning model has introduced is a great challenge, due to the numerous definitions of fairness and the large number of potentially impacted subgroups. We present FairVis, a mixed-initiative visual analytics system that integrates a novel subgroup discovery technique for users to audit the fairness of machine learning models. Through FairVis, users can apply domain knowledge to generate and investigate known subgroups, and explore suggested and similar subgroups. FairVis’ coordinated views enable users to explore a high-level overview of subgroup performance and subsequently drill down into detailed investigation of specific subgroups. We show how FairVis helps to discover biases in two real datasets used in predicting income and recidivism. As a visual analytics system devoted to discovering bias in machine learning, FairVis demonstrates how interactive visualization may help data scientists and the general public understand and create more equitable algorithmic systems.
